A new channel is created whenever a user messages the bot, and the channel will serve as a shared
inbox for seamless communication between staff and the user.

## Self-hosting

This guide requires you to have basic knowledge about command line, Docker and Discord bots. We
will not provide any form of support for self-hosting.

First, create a Discord bot on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers). You must
enable the server member intent and the message content intent for the bot to function.

Then, install Git and Docker on your machine. Clone this repository, copy `docker/.env.example` to
`docker/.env` and fill in all the configurations.

Finally, use the following commands to start ModMail.

```
./build.sh
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

Your self-hosted bot should be up now. Congratulations!

If you would prefer to not build your own images, then in `docker/docker-compose.yml` comment out the `modmail-xxx:dev` lines and uncomment the `chamburr/modmail-xxx:latest` lines and do not run `./build.sh`
