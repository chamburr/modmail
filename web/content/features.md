# Powerful Features

We believe that every Discord bot should be packed with great features. That's why we've done so for
ModMail! An example is our beautifully designed log viewer, which allows server staff to read past
transcripts pleasantly.

# Easy to Use

All you need to do to set up ModMail is to type =setup! For the users, they only need to message the
bot to contact your server staff. Then, your server staff can easily reply by sending a message in
the dedicated channel.

# Reliable and High Quality

With our revolutionary infrastructure implementation, we're proud to achieve absolute 100% uptime!
This means that ModMail will always be online, and ready to relay messages between your server staff
and users!

# Customizable Settings

Adjust the settings to fit all the needs of your server! You can select who can access the tickets,
the roles to notify for new tickets, whether to reply anonymously, the channel to send message logs
to, and more...

# Open Source

We are an open source project on GitHub. Don't believe what we've said earlier? Check out the source
code for yourself! This means the maximum level of transparency, so you'll never have to worry about
privacy concerns.

# And Much More...

There are many more goodies available in ModMail, such as blacklisting users, saving messages as
snippets, automated greeting and closing messages. Discover the rest of the amazing features on your
own!
