# Intuitive Commands

Our goal is to make the end-user experience as good as possible, be it the moderators or the users.
No more fumbling to find that command you wrote down and instead, use our interactive help with the
=help command!

# Feature Rich

We believe that a ModMail bot should not only fulfill the roles of relaying messages, it should also
be packed with loads of other great features. A great example is our beautiful logs viewer which
allows server moderators to read through the transcripts presented in a pleasing manner.

# Reliable and High Quality

With our revolutionary gateway implementation written in the fastest language in the world, we're
proud to achieve absolute 100% uptime! ModMail can help relay messages to and fro between your staff
and users at any time!

# Customizable Settings

Adjust the settings to fit your server. Choose the who can access the tickets, the bot's prefix and
even whether you want staff to reply anonymously! You can even move tickets out of its original
category if you want!

# Open Source

We are an open source project on GitHub. Don't believe what we've said earlier? Check out the source
code for yourself! Open source means the maximum level of transparency, so you will never have to
worry about privacy concerns.

# And Much More...

There are many more goodies available in Wyvor, such as advanced logging, snippets, greeting and
closing messages, just to name a few. Discover the rest of the features on your own!
