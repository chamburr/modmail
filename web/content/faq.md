# What is ModMail?

ModMail is a feature-rich Discord bot designed to enable your server members to contact staff
easily.

# How do I set up ModMail?

Simply run =setup in your server.

# How do I use ModMail to contact staff?

Message the bot what you would like to send.

# Where do I get ModMail premium?

Please go to https://modmail.xyz/premium.

# Why is the bot not responding?

Please check the following before asking for help.

\- The bot has Read Messages, Send Messages, and Embed Links permissions.

\- You are using the correct prefix. Use @ModMail prefix to check the prefix.

\- The command you are using is valid. Check using =help \<command\>.

\- The bot is online. Discord might be having issues, or the bot might be restarting.

# The bot says that a category is not found, what should I do?

If you are a server admin, this is telling you that the bot is not set up properly. If you have
previously used =setup, you might have deleted the category. Either use =category \[name\] to create
the category or =setup to set up everything again.

# How do I change the server I want to send the message to?

Simply react with üîÅ on the confirmation message and you will be asked to choose. If you have
confirmation message disabled, use =new \<message\> instead. There is also a shortcut to that: =send
\<server ID\> \<message\>.

# Why is the custom emote I sent not working?

Due to Discord requirements, the bot needs to be in the server where the emote is from in order to
use it.

# Why is the ModMail log not working?

This is most likely due to a lack of permission. If it still does not work with full permissions,
you can try deleting the channel and run =logging to enable it again.

# How do I change the prefix of the bot?

Use the command =prefix \<new prefix\>.

# Can I rename the ModMail channel?

Yes. you can.

# Is the bot open source?

Yes! See https://github.com/chamburr/modmail. However, we will not provide any help for
self-hosting.

# None of these helped me!
