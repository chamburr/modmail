# What is Wyvor?

Wyvor is the best feature-rich Discord music bot. Take control over your music with an intuitive
dashboard, custom effects and more! Learn more about the bot on the home page.

# How do I get started with the bot?

Use .help to get started with Wyvor! The command list can be found on the commands page. We also
recommend you to use our feature-rich and intuitive dashboard for the best experience.

# Are there any Wyvor premium plans?

Yes, scroll down to the footer.

Long answer: No, we do not have any premium plans. Thanks to our robust infrastructure and efficient
implementations, we are able to keep resource usage at the very low. Thus, we currently do not
require any funding.

# How do I change the bot prefix?

You can change the bot prefix in the dashboard settings, or with the .prefix [new prefix] command.

# How do I change the bot settings?

You can do this through the dashboard settings.

# What platforms does Wyvor support?

We support YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Vimeo, Twitch streams, files and HTTP URLs.

Why don't you support Spotify? Well, other bots which falsely claim to "support" Spotify only
searches the track there, but actually plays from other platforms like YouTube. For legal reasons,
we cannot play tracks from Spotify.

# Why is the bot appearing to be offline?

This is because of a Discord issue, or a third-party issue such as our hosting provider. For more
information, you should check out the Discord status page or join our support server.

# Why is the bot not responding to commands?

Please ensure that the bot has the read messages, send messages and embed links permission. In
addition, check that you are using a valid command with the correct prefix. Let us know on the
support server if it still does not respond!

# Why is the bot not playing anything?

Please ensure that there is a currently playing track, the track is not paused, and that the volume
is set correctly. Also, check that the equalizer is not making an impact on the volume.

# Why is the sound lagging?

If the bot is consistently lagging, please try to switch the server region and kindly let us know,
so we will be able to look into the issue!

# Why is the sound so weird?

This is likely because you have some effects set, or the equalizer is adjusted. Please try to reset
the filters and attempt to play another track if it is still abnormal.

# Why is the dashboard not working?

This is a known bug with Google Chrome when you open multiple tabs of the same dashboard. To
mitigate, please only open the dashboard in one tab.

# Can I invite a second Wyvor bot?

Unfortunately, due to how the dashboard currently works, it is not possible to have multiple
instances. Please wait patiently as we are working on implementing this!

# Can I change the username or avatar?

No, Discord does not support this. You could however change the nickname in your server.

# How do I report a bug or suggest something?

Please use the issue tracker on our GitHub repository. If you do not have a GitHub account, you may
also let us know through our support server.

# Can the bot be self-hosted?

Yes, the bot is open source on GitHub and you can self-host it.

Here's the catch: The bot has a complex infrastructure written in multiple languages, and unless you
are very familiar with all of them, self-hosting could be very challenging. We are currently working
on a way to run the bot with Docker.

# None of these helped me!
